          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

            React state management is a process for managing the data that React components need in order to render
            themselves. This data is typically stored in the component's state object. When the state object changes,
            the component will re-render itself. React state management is basically half of a React app

          How does prototypical inheritance work?

            The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a
            method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order
            to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?

          <p>
            The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.
            Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect
            early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.

          React vs. Angular vs. Vue?

            React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive
            framework. They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they’re not 100
            percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences.
